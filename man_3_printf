NAME
       _printf - custom printf function

SYNOPSIS
       #include <main.h>

       int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The  _printf  function is a custom implementation of the standard printf
       function in C. It takes a format string and a variable number of  argu-
       ments and prints the formatted output to the standard output (stdout).

       The format string can contain ordinary characters as well as format spe-
       cifiers that begin with the '%' character, followed by a conversion spe-
       cifier character.

       The supported conversion specifiers are:

       %c     Print a single character.

       %s     Print a null-terminated string.

       %i     Print a signed integer.

       %d     Print a signed integer (same as %i).

       %%     Print a single '%' character.

RETURN VALUE
       The  _printf  function  returns the number of characters printed on suc-
       cess. On failure, it returns -1.
